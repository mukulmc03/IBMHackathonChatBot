In this project we have achieved the goal of answering the users question through chat bot.The main objectives of the project were to develop an algorithm that 
will be used to identify answers related to user submitted questions. To develop a database were all the related data will be stored and to develop a web interface.
The web interface developed had two parts, one for simple users and one for the administrator. 


A background research took place, which included an overview of the conversation procedure and any relevant chat bots available. A database was developed, which 
stores information about questions, answers, keywords, logs and feedback messages. A usable system was designed, developed and deployed to the web server on 
two occasions. An evaluation took place from data collected by potential students of the College. Also after received feedback from the first deployment, 
extra requirements were introduced and implemented.
